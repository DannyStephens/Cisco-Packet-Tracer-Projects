# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Projects

Welcome to my collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs and network simulation projects. This repository showcases my personal approach to designing, configuring, and troubleshooting various network topologies and scenarios. The goal is to demonstrate a solid understanding of networking principles, hands-on proficiency with Cisco technologies, and a commitment to continuous learning in network engineering.

| [Basic two VLAN network](./Basic%20two%20VLAN%20network.pkt) | This topology demonstrates a simple network using two VLANs, where VLAN 10 (PC7 and PC8) and VLAN 20 (PC9 and PC10) are connected to two separate switches, both linked to a central router (Router1) for inter-VLAN communication. The router is configured with subinterfaces to route traffic between the VLANs, enabling devices in different VLANs to communicate through Router-on-a-Stick configuration.        | 12/09/2025      |
| [DHCP on two VLANs network](./DHCP%20on%20two%20VLANs%20network.pkt) | This network setup features a central router (Router1) acting as a DHCP server, automatically assigning IP addresses to all connected PCs (PC3 to PC8) across two switches. The topology eliminates the need for manual IP configuration, allowing all devices to be part of a single network and communicate seamlessly using dynamically assigned IPs.       | 12/09/2025      |
